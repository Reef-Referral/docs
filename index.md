# How Reef Referral Works
Here is how the experience looks like from the user's point of view

------ 



This example uses a standard mode taking advantage of AppStore Offer Codes. The UI on the screenshot below is an example one, you have a flexibility to use your own design.

## 1. The sending user shares a link

Prompt the users to share the link with their friends.

<img src="/assets/images/step1.png" style="max-height:800px; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"/>

## 2. Their friend opens the offer page and can download the app and redeem the offer.

You can customise the text of on the offer page to make it your own.

<img src="/assets/images/step2.png" style="max-height:800px; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"/>

## 3. The link opens up the app app and immediately redirects to the App Store to accept offer.

<img src="/assets/images/step3.png" style="max-height:800px;"/>


{: .note-title}

> The AppStore redirects the user back to the app
> 
> At this moment, Reef Referral checks if the offer has been redeemed and counts it for the sending user.

## 4. The sending user can now redeem their reward.

<img src="/assets/images/step4.png" style="max-height:800px;"/>


{:.note-title}
> Customise sender reward
>
> The sender reward can be implemented as an offer code (the standard option) or you can add custom customisation in your app, like a badge or some kind of points.
